# apb: Android Pixel Bot
> gacha auto farming made easy

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- An Android phone

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Souler/apb.git
$ cd apb
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```
$ node bin/apb.js ./scripts/pokemon_masters_general_farm.yml
```

## Motivation

I recently binge-played [Pok√©mon Masters](https://pokemonmasters-game.com/en-US). While I loved the story and the challenge it brought, once that is done you can only level up by grinding some materials. The grind is so repetitive that even the game features an Auto mode so you can do battles automatically.
